# responsive-project

HELLO!
I hope you enjoy using this website.
It may look rough around the edges, but thats because it is.
However I am still proud that I actually managed to create something that worked, let a lot responsive.
This is basically the limit of my coding abilities will let me accomplish (aside from some light procrastination).
I faced many challenges during this assignment, and I believe the "code" I used managed to somehow overcome (most of) them.
And the challenged I couldn't overcome I simply pretended didn't exist.
I would've included my lofi-prototype, however Im pretty sure it became disintagrated pocket lint in my washing machine? I can garentee it looks basically the same as my website's final form.
I got a lot of help from the W3C School, and got me through some tough times.
...
As I'm writing this I can see that the time is 12:01 (oops) so i'm going to stop writing and submit it.
