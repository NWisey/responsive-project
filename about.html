  TV and radio host, comedian, author and self-confessed ‘Design Nerd’, Tim ‘Rosso’ Ross has always had a passion for architecture and design has advocated in this space for many years, often in new, engaging and hilarious ways. 


    A long-time supporter of Canberra Modern, having performed several of his sell out shows within the festival, Tim also passionately supports important issues in Australian architecture and design and speaks nationally on preserving Australia’s important architectural character and the legacy of the many great designers of our nation. 
    
    
    In 2018, Tim was awarded the National Trust Heritage Award for Advocacy and in 2019, the National President’s Prize from the Australian Institute of Architects, to “recognise him for his advocacy, activism and outstanding contribution to the architecture profession”.
    
    
    Canberra Modern are thrilled to have Tim as our Patron and look forward to many years of collaboration and celebration of the rich mid-century character of our National Capital.
